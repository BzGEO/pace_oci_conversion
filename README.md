# Scripts for extracting NASA PACE OCI vegetation index (LandVI) data to GeoTIF format
R scripts for converting PACE LandVI data from the original NetCDF to GeoTIF

## Description: Why do I need these scripts?
*Scenario: You are a regular GIS user. You have downloaded **LARGE** PACE OCI vegetation index files in NetCDF format from [NASA EarthData](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) or the [NASA OB.DAAC](https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/l3/) and you just want to extract the data in GeoTIF for use in [ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/overview) or [QGIS](https://qgis.org/).*
